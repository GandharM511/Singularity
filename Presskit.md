# Singularity

## Description
Specimen 153, an intergalatic anomaly, was captured by hostile aliens to be tested on in their lab. They were subjugated to deadly experiments and tests, one of which broke their existence in two. While split apart, the specimen must now escape the aliens' lab to finally become one again - a Singularity.

Singularity is a 2D Puzzle Platformer that takes place between two seperate realms. Players must traverse these connected dimenstions to complete each trial, all in hope to become one again.
